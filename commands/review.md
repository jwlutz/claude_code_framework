If no `.vibe/`: "No vibe context found. Run /vibe:init first."

## Phase 1 - Five-part review

Dispatch reviewer + tester **in parallel (single message)**:

**Reviewer** (`subagent_type="vibe:reviewer"` or `"general-purpose"`). Prompt with: changed files (git diff), current.md, understanding.md patterns, risks.md baseline, bugs.md. Instruction:
"Adversarial five-part review:
1. **Spec compliance:** match intent/plan from current.md?
2. **Code quality:** patterns, style, error handling, security (validation, auth, secrets, injection)
3. **Bug review:** logic errors, off-by-one, null, race conditions, edge cases, error propagation. Cross-check bugs.md for reintroductions.
4. **Functionality:** does it work as intended? All paths reachable and tested? Integrations correct?
5. **Risk scan:** compare vs risks.md baseline. Report delta per impact level.
Output: `[CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] file:line: issue - fix`. Verdict: APPROVE or NEEDS FIXES."

**Tester** (`subagent_type="vibe:tester"` or `"general-purpose"`). Instruction: "Run project tests, debug/ tests, linters. If Playwright detected + frontend changes: `npx playwright test --reporter=list` (check dev server at localhost:3000/5173, start with 60s timeout if down). Skip Playwright for backend-only."

## Phase 2 - Write findings + test gaps

- `bugs.md`: bugs found with next ID and impact
- `risks.md`: new risks with next ID. Resolved risks (file:line gone) to Resolved section with date. Update baseline.
- Check `debug/` for gaps: changed code without tests? Generate missing tests, verify they pass.

## Phase 3 - Review gate

**[STOP IF CRITICAL/HIGH]** Present findings with verdict.

## Phase 4 - Simplification

Propose changes with before/after snippets for recently changed code only. **[STOP]** User approves individually.
Rules: preserve functionality, don't touch untouched code, don't add features/abstractions/renames.
Valid: dead code, redundant conditionals, verbose patterns, duplicated logic.

## Phase 5 - Summary + next steps

Impact counts, verdict, risk delta, test results, simplifications applied.

Based on verdict:
- `APPROVE`: "Ready to commit. Run `/vibe:commit`."
- `NEEDS FIXES` with bugs: "Run `/vibe:go fix #N` or `/vibe:plan` for broader fix."
- `NEEDS FIXES` with risks: "Run `/vibe:go fix #RN` to address."
- Mixed: list each ID. "Fix individually or `/vibe:plan fix review findings` to tackle together."
